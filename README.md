Welcome to the README file of Quintilianus. Quintilianus is a project started in spring of 2022 by Patrick Neff. It is his first effort to create a suite of Latin language learning tools to be used by English language speaking students of Latin in general, and Cambridge Latin Course using students in particular. In addition to hosting games that help students study and review the Latin language, Quintilianus includes some social media type functionality to encourage students to encourage one another. 

Minimum Viable Product:
-User accounts and pages 
    -Places for user to describe their Latin language learning journey
    -Walls for the user and friends "amici" to comment
    -Pecunia (Latin for "money"), the point system in Quintilianus; completing various tasks earns pecunia for users
    -Friending feature, where users can add other users they know
-Verble
    -Latin version of Worlde
    -For solving the daily Verble, users will earn one "denarius" (unit of pecunia)
    -For solving and correctly answering a multiple choice popup question about the meaning of the Verble word, users will earn a bonus denarius.
